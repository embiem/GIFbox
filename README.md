# GIFbox

This thing is WIP, but it already works. What is it? It's a python script which creates a video using the Pi's camera, then magically transforms this video into a GIF. Oh, and it has a ReactJS front-end WebApp as UI.

## How To

* Have a Raspberry Pi & the Pi's camera already set-up and ready to go.
* clone this repo & `cd` into it
* run `npm install` in the root of this repo
* `cd` into the `app` folder
* run `npm install` again
* `cd ..`
* `npm run start`
* open a browser
* navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## The End

That's it for now. Thanks for reading me. Sadly, I didn't receive more love yet.
